## 1. Diagram Types & Layout Rules（原文归档）

### Architecture Diagram
Nodes = services/components. Group into **horizontal layers** (top→bottom or left→right).
- Typical layers: Client → Gateway/LB → Services → Data/Storage
- Use `<rect>` dashed containers to group related services in the same layer
- Arrow direction follows data/request flow
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` standard, `0 0 960 800` for tall stacks

### Data Flow Diagram
Emphasizes **what data moves where**. Focus on data transformation.
- Label every arrow with the data type (e.g., "embeddings", "query", "context")
- Use wider arrows (`stroke-width: 2.5`) for primary data paths
- Dashed arrows for control/trigger flows
- Color arrows by data category (not just Agent/RAG — use semantics)

### Flowchart / Process Flow
Sequential decision/process steps.
- Top-to-bottom preferred; left-to-right for wide flows
- Diamond shapes for decisions, rounded rects for processes, parallelograms for I/O
- Keep node labels short (≤3 words); put detail in sub-labels
- Align nodes on a grid: x positions snap to 120px intervals, y to 80px

### Agent Architecture Diagram
Shows how an AI agent reasons, uses tools, and manages memory.
Key conceptual layers to always consider:
- **Input layer**: User, query, trigger
- **Agent core**: LLM, reasoning loop, planner
- **Memory layer**: Short-term (context window), Long-term (vector/graph DB), Episodic
- **Tool layer**: Tool calls, APIs, search, code execution
- **Output layer**: Response, action, side-effects
Use cyclic arrows (loop arcs) to show iterative reasoning. Separate memory types visually.

### Memory Architecture Diagram (Mem0, MemGPT-style)
Specialized agent diagram focused on memory operations.
- Show memory **write path** and **read path** separately (different arrow colors)
- Memory tiers: Working Memory → Short-term → Long-term → External Store
- Label memory operations: `store()`, `retrieve()`, `forget()`, `consolidate()`
- Use stacked rects or layered cylinders for storage tiers

### Sequence Diagram
Time-ordered message exchanges between participants.
- Participants as vertical **lifelines** (top labels + vertical dashed lines)
- Messages as horizontal arrows between lifelines, top-to-bottom time order
- Activation boxes (thin filled rects on lifeline) show active processing
- Group with `<rect>` loop/alt frames with label in top-left corner
- ViewBox height = 80 + (num_messages × 50)

### Comparison / Feature Matrix
Side-by-side comparison of approaches, systems, or components.
- Column headers = systems, row headers = attributes
- Row height: 40px; column width: min 120px; header row height: 50px
- Checked cell: tinted background (e.g. `#dcfce7`) + `✓` checkmark; unsupported: `#f9fafb` fill
- Alternating row fills (`#f9fafb` / `#ffffff`) for readability
- Max readable columns: 5; beyond that, split into two diagrams

### Timeline / Gantt
Horizontal time axis showing durations, phases, and milestones.
- X-axis = time (weeks/months/quarters); Y-axis = items/tasks/phases
- Bars: rounded rects, colored by category, labeled inside or beside
- Milestone markers: diamond or filled circle at specific x position with label above
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 400` typical; wider for many time periods: `0 0 1200 400`

### Mind Map / Concept Map
Radial layout from central concept.
- Central node at `cx=480, cy=280`
- First-level branches: evenly distributed around center (360/N degrees)
- Second-level branches: branch off first-level at 30-45° offset
- Use curved `<path>` with cubic bezier for branches, not straight lines

### Class Diagram (UML)
Static structure showing classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **Class box**: 3-compartment rect (name / attributes / methods), min width 160px
  - Top compartment: class name, bold, centered (abstract = *italic*)
  - Middle: attributes with visibility (`+` public, `-` private, `#` protected)
  - Bottom: method signatures, same visibility notation
- **Relationships**:
  - Inheritance (extends): solid line + hollow triangle arrowhead, child → parent
  - Implementation (interface): dashed line + hollow triangle, class → interface
  - Association: solid line + open arrowhead, label with multiplicity (1, 0..*, 1..*)
  - Aggregation: solid line + hollow diamond on container side
  - Composition: solid line + filled diamond on container side
  - Dependency: dashed line + open arrowhead
- **Interface**: `<<interface>>` stereotype above name, or circle/lollipop notation
- **Enum**: compartment rect with `<<enumeration>>` stereotype, values in bottom
- Layout: parent classes top, children below; interfaces to the left/right of implementors
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` standard; `0 0 960 800` for deep hierarchies

### Use Case Diagram (UML)
System functionality from user perspective.
- **Actor**: stick figure (circle head + body line) placed outside system boundary
  - Label below figure, 13-14px
  - Primary actors on left, secondary/supporting on right
- **Use case**: ellipse with label centered inside, min 140×60px
  - Keep names verb phrases: "Create Order", "Process Payment"
- **System boundary**: large rect with dashed border + system name in top-left
- **Relationships**:
  - Include: dashed arrow `<<include>>` from base to included use case
  - Extend: dashed arrow `<<extend>>` from extension to base use case
  - Generalization: solid line + hollow triangle (specialized → general)
- Layout: system boundary centered, actors outside, use cases inside
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` standard

### State Machine Diagram (UML)
Lifecycle states and transitions of an entity.
- **State**: rounded rect with state name, min 120×50px
  - Internal activities: small text `entry/ action`, `exit/ action`, `do/ activity`
  - **Initial state**: filled black circle (r=8), one outgoing arrow
  - **Final state**: filled circle (r=8) inside hollow circle (r=12)
  - **Choice**: small hollow diamond, guard labels on outgoing arrows `[condition]`
- **Transition**: arrow with optional label `event [guard] / action`
  - Guard conditions in square brackets
  - Actions after `/`
- **Composite/nested state**: larger rect containing sub-states, with name tab
- **Fork/join**: thick horizontal or vertical black bar (synchronization)
- Layout: initial state top-left, final state bottom-right, flow top-to-bottom
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` standard

### ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship)
Database schema and data relationships.
- **Entity**: rect with entity name in header (bold), attributes below
  - Primary key attribute: underlined
  - Foreign key: italic or marked with (FK)
  - Min width: 160px; attribute font-size: 12px
- **Relationship**: diamond shape on connecting line
  - Label inside diamond: "has", "belongs to", "enrolls in"
  - Cardinality labels near entity: `1`, `N`, `0..1`, `0..*`, `1..*`
- **Weak entity**: double-bordered rect with double diamond relationship
- **Associative entity**: diamond + rect hybrid (rect with diamond inside)
- Line style: solid for identifying relationships, dashed for non-identifying
- Layout: entities in 2-3 rows, relationships between related entities
- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` standard; wider `0 0 1200 600` for many entities

### Network Topology
Physical or logical network infrastructure.
- **Devices**: icon-like rects or rounded rects

|-----------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Primary data flow | blue `#2563eb` | 2px solid | none | Main request/response path |
| Control / trigger | orange `#ea580c` | 1.5px solid | none | One system triggering another |
| Memory read | green `#059669` | 1.5px solid | none | Retrieval from store |
| Memory write | green `#059669` | 1.5px | `5,3` | Write/store operation |
| Async / event | gray `#6b7280` | 1.5px | `4,2` | Non-blocking, event-driven |
| Embedding / transform | purple `#7c3aed` | 1px solid | none | Data transformation |
| Feedback / loop | purple `#7c3aed` | 1.5px curved | none | Iterative reasoning loop |

Always include a **legend** when 2+ arrow types are used.

## 5. Layout Principles（原文归档）

**Alignment**: Snap node centers to **8px base grid**. Horizontal: 120px intervals. Vertical: 120px intervals (consistent layer spacing).

**Grouping**: Use `<rect>` with dashed stroke + semi-transparent fill + small label in top-left to visually group related nodes. Don't group more than 5-6 nodes in one box.

**Layering**: For complex diagrams, divide into named swim-lanes with subtle background fills.

**Spacing**:
- Same-layer nodes: 80px horizontal spacing (consistent)
- Between layers: 120px vertical spacing (consistent)
- Canvas margins: 40px minimum on all sides
- Minimum 60px between node edges

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- **Core/primary nodes**: 20-30% larger than standard, double border or 3-4px stroke
- **Secondary nodes**: Standard size, 2-2.5px stroke
- **Tertiary nodes**: Standard size, 1.5-2px stroke
- **Color hierarchy**: Core = high saturation, Secondary = medium saturation, Tertiary = low saturation/grayscale

**Labels on arrows**:
- Short (≤3 words), placed mid-arrow
- **MUST have background rect**: `<rect>` with fill matching canvas background, placed behind text
- Background rect padding: 4px horizontal, 2px vertical
- Never overlap with nodes (maintain 10px safety distance)
- When multiple arrows converge, stagger label vertical positions by 15-20px

**Arrow Routing**:
- **Prefer orthogonal routing**: vertical then horizontal segments to minimize crossings
- **Layer-based routing**: different semantic flows use different "channels" (y-offsets)
- **Crossing minimization**: route arrows around dense node clusters
- **Jump-over arcs**: when crossings unavoidable, use small arc (5px radius) at intersection point

## 6. Best Practices（原文归档）

### Text Size Hierarchy
- **Title**: 24-28px, font-weight: 700
- **Layer labels**: 16-18px, font-weight: 600
- **Node main labels**: 16-18px, font-weight: 600
- **Node sub-labels**: 13-14px, font-weight: 400
- **Arrow labels**: 12-13px, font-weight: 400
- **Legend**: 11-12px, font-weight: 400

### Node Size Hierarchy
- **Core nodes**: 1.25x standard size, 3-4px stroke or double border
- **Secondary nodes**: Standard size (180x90), 2-2.5px stroke
- **Tertiary nodes**: Standard size, 1.5-2px stroke

### Legend Requirements
- **Placement**: Right-upper corner (x=760, y=40) or left-lower corner (x=40, y=520)
- **Content**: Must include arrow types, node types (if >2 types), color semantics
- **Style**: Match diagram style but use subtle background to distinguish

## 7. Common Mistakes（原文归档）

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Arrows crossing over nodes | Route around with orthogonal paths or bezier detour |
| Too many arrow colors | Max 4 semantic colors per diagram; combine similar flows |
| Unlabeled arrows | Always label; put text mid-arrow on white/dark bg rect |
| No grouping on complex graphs | Add swim-lane rects for groups >4 nodes |
| Text overflow | `text-anchor="middle"` + clip or shorten label |
| PNG missing | Run rsvg-convert immediately after SVG write; report if unavailable |
| Style mismatch | Load style reference file before generating any SVG |

## 8. Frequently Used Flow Patterns（原文归档）

These patterns appear frequently — internalize them:

**RAG Pipeline**: Query → Embed → VectorSearch → Retrieve → Augment → LLM → Response
**Agentic RAG**: adds Agent loop with Tool use between Query and LLM
**Agentic Search**: Query → Planner → [Search Tool / Calculator / Code] → Synthesizer → Response
**Mem0 / Memory Layer**: Input → Memory Manager → [Write: VectorDB + GraphDB] / [Read: Retrieve+Rank] → Context
**Agent Memory Types**: Sensory (raw input) → Working (context window) → Episodic (past interactions) → Semantic (facts) → Procedural (skills)
**Multi-Agent**: Orchestrator → [SubAgent A / SubAgent B / SubAgent C] → Aggregator → Output
**Tool Call Flow**: LLM → Tool Selector → Tool Execution → Result Parser → LLM (loop)
